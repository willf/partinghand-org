Dear folks,
John Hyde had a massive stroke last night Sept 8, 2006. His family did not want any heroic efforts. He passed away this evening a little after 5pm. He was 87 years of age. John was fun to be with and loved his wife Josie, his children and grandchildren, sacred harp and people. We will miss him but there is a great homecoming going on right now in heaven.</description></item><item><title>Judy Mincey</title><link>https://partinghand.org/directions/judy-mincey/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://partinghand.org/directions/judy-mincey/</guid><description>The below are suggestions and, of course, are not a complete list of all my favorites.
