So, when it comes time for others to sing on our behalf, how will they know what our favorite songs were?\nThe Parting Hand is a place for people to list the names of their favorite tunes in the hopes that, when \u0026ldquo;the evening shades appear,\u0026rdquo; their friends and loved ones will know what to sing. Of course, it would be appropriate to record other intentions here\u0026ndash;such as scripture verses to read, things to do, and so on.\nIf you would like to have a page on this site, please send an email to either of the moderators with a note describing:\n The tunes (and tunebooks) you would like to be remembered by Who should be contacted Any other information you\u0026rsquo;d like to make public  Check out other peoples\u0026rsquo; pages to get an idea of what others have done.\nAnd if you would like to add links to recordings or photographs (or suggest new kinds of links), please send email to either of the moderators.\nIn bonds of love, your moderators,\n Will Fitzgerald (website email is \u0026ndash; will dot fitzgerald at pobox dot com) Annie Grieshop  "
