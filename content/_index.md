## When I am gone

{{< lead >}}
Many of us tend to move around, and many of us aren't always surrounded by folks who know us well. So, when it comes time for others to sing on our behalf, how will they know what our favorite songs were?

The Parting Hand is a place for people to list the names of their favorite tunes in the hopes that, when "the evening shades appear," their friends and loved ones will know what to sing. Of course, it would be appropriate to record other intentions here--such as scripture verses to read, things to do, and so on.

If you would like to have a page on this site, please send an email to either of the moderators with a note describing:

- The tunes (and tunebooks) you would like to be remembered by
- Who should be contacted
- Any other information you'd like to make public

Check out other peoples' pages to get an idea of what others have done.

And if you would like to add links to recordings or photographs (or suggest new kinds of links), please send email to either of the moderators.

In bonds of love, your moderators,

- Annie Grieshop (annie at allthingspiano dot com)
