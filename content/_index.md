<div style="display:block; margin: 0 auto; width: 560px">
My Christian friends, in bonds of love,<br />
Whose hearts in sweetest union join,<br />  
Your friendship’s like a drawing band,<br />  
Yet we must take the parting hand.<br />  
<br />
Your company’s sweet, your union dear, <br />  
Your words delightful to my ear;<br />   
Yet when I see that we must part<br />   
You draw like cords around my heart.<br />   
<br /> 
How sweet the hours have passed away  <br /> 
Since we have met to sing and pray;  <br /> 
How loath we are to leave the place  <br /> 
Where Jesus shows His smiling face.  <br /> 
<br /> 
Oh could I stay with friends so kind,  <br /> 
How would it cheer my drooping mind!  <br /> 
But duty makes me understand  <br /> 
That we must take the parting hand.<br />
