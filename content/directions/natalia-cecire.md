### Tunes
- 272 Exhortation
- 384 Panting for Heaven
- 556 Portland
- 448t Consecration
- 320 Funeral Anthem
- 260 Farewell Anthem
 
BUT NOT: 340 Odem. I don't care how appropriate you think it is; it is a lame tune. And in general, nothing that would have made me roll my eyes at a singing. 254 Rose of Sharon is permissible only in a spirit of irony.
