From the fasola discussion list:


Dear folks,

John Hyde had a massive stroke last night Sept 8, 2006. His family did not want any
heroic efforts. He passed away this evening a little after 5pm. He was 87
years of age. John was fun to be with and loved his wife Josie, his children
and grandchildren, sacred harp and people. We will miss him but there is a
great homecoming going on right now in heaven.



John liked 43, 124, 297.


 
Please remember Josie and the family. Thanks to everyone for the calls,
cards, visits and prayers.

 
Richard Mauldin
