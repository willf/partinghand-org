### Tunes

 
I don't have many tunes that might be considered to "have my name on them," so to speak. But if I have any tune by which I can be identified, it's probably 456. I just love that song. And I love the music to that part, "When to that Sacred Mount you rise..."

 
I used to have a long list of other tunes for people to sing. But that seems not to fit now. It seems better just to let people sing what tunes remind them of me, because those come from the heart then. (Only, please don't sing "Spring." I never liked that tune.)

 

### Tell

- The Minnesota singers (try Steve Luttinen or Paul Wyatt or Karen Swenson)
- Cathryn Bearov of Chicago
- Anyone else who wants to know
 

 

### Other

Sacred Harp has been the defining factor of my life for many years now. It's in my bones. Even if I left, never sang again, it would still be with me. I have no family to pass it on to, so I would like it if singers would do that for me by holding singing schools and doing outreach, so that the singing stays alive, healthy and growing, even after I'm gone.
