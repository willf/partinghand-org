#### New Harp of Columbia:

68 Paradise, repeat refrain in both notes and text
 

#### Christian Harmony 2010:

393b China, all three verses 
546b Oak Grove
 

#### Sacred Harp;

448t Consecration, repeat refrain in both notes and text
 

#### Don't even think of singing 
- anything that says New Britain or begins with "Amazing grace..."  Nothing!
- and don't sing anything with the words, "...and corn in valleys grow".  I hate all of them.  <G> &#128512;

 
#### On the other hand, I like the songs that contain the words, "...and don't forget to pray." 

Other than that, sing anything you think I'd like, that I've led in the past, or that I've mentioned as a favorite in the past, etc.
