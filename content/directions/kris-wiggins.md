### Where I'm from 
Dallas, Texas

 
 
### Please sing 
at my funeral, memorial service, or wherever my family deems appropriate (I don’t really care) 

#### Denson book

- The Last Words of Copernicus (112)- this song, to me, has some of the most interesting poetry in the book
- Gospel Trumpet (99)
- Long Sought Home (235)- vs 1 & 3, repeat last chorus softly
- For my final Sacred Harp selection(s), I would like my wife and my sister to pick a song for me.
 

### Consider reading this scripture

- I have always liked 2 Timothy 2:11-13
- Family is of course free to pick additional scriptures
 

### Tell 
All my family and Sacred Harp family.  I would love for everyone I’ve ever sung with to be there, but I’ll settle for anyone who can make it!
